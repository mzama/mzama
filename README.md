# Hello there!
  
Iâ€™m Matteo Zamaria, a self-taught software developer with a passion for creating.
I first started teaching myself to code as a child, and became hooked.
Whether simple tools to help make life more convenient, or fun interactive and informative projects, I love to be able to use code to make things that can be used or experienced.
Through independent projects and online courses, I have been training myself as a full-stack web developer.
I also enjoy working in Unity. I love to learn and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and capabilities.  

### I'm looking to create software to improve people's lives, and opportunities to learn and improve myself.
