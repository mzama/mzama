# Hello there!  
  
Iâ€™m Matteo Zamaria, a self-taught software developer with a passion for creating.
I started learning to code as a child, and immediately became hooked.
Whether a tool to help make life more convenient, or a fun or informative project, I love using code to make things that are practical, entertaining, and intuitive.
I am a self-taught full stack web developer and also enjoy game development through various projects in Unity. 
I love to learn and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and capabilities.  

####  My aim is to make software to improve people's lives while continuing to learn and grow myself.
